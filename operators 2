## Arithmetic Operators  
print(12 + 5)   # Addition  
print(12 - 5)   # Subtraction  
print(12 * 5)   # Multiplication  
print(12 ** 2)  # Exponentiation (12 raised to the power of 2)  
print(12 / 5)   # Division (always returns a float)  
print(12 // 5)  # Floor division (rounds down to the nearest whole number)  
print(7 % 5)    # Modulus (remainder of 7 divided by 5)  

## Logical and Comparison Operators  
# Comparisons return Boolean values (True or False)  
print(8 > 3)    # Greater than (returns True)  
print(8 >= 3)   # Greater than or equal to (returns True)  
print(8 != 8)   # Not equal to (returns False)  
print(8 == 8)   # Equal to (returns True)  
print(8 == 5 + 3)  # Evaluates if 8 is equal to (5+3), returns True  

### = is an assignment operator, whereas == is a comparison operator. Do not confuse them!  

## Equality Operators  
print(15 == 30)  # False  
print(15 != 30)  # True  
print(1 == True)  # True (as any non-zero number is considered True)  
print(False == False)  # True  
print("python" == "python")  # True  
print(20 == "python")  # False (different data types)  

### Logical Operators  
# 'and' -> Both conditions must be True for the result to be True  
x = 15  
y = 25  
if x > 10 and y > 20:  
    print("Both x and y are greater than their respective values")  

if x > 20 and y > 20:  
    print("This won't print as one condition is False")  

# 'or' -> At least one condition must be True for the result to be True  
m = 10  
n = -3  
if m > 0 or n > 0:  
    print("At least one of m or n is greater than 0")  

# 'not' -> Negates the condition  
p = False  
if not p:  
    print("p is False")  
else:  
    print("p is True")
