## Assigning values to variables
x = 15  
print(x)  # Outputs 15  

## Addition assignment  
x += 7  # Equivalent to x = x + 7  
print(x)  

## Subtraction assignment  
x -= 4  # Subtracts 4 from the existing value of x  
print(x)  

## Multiplication assignment  
x *= 3  # Multiplies the current value of x by 3  
print(x)  

## Division assignment  
x /= 5  # Divides x by 5 (Always results in a float)  
print(x)  

## Modulus assignment  
x %= 4  # Stores the remainder when x is divided by 4  
print(x)  

## Exponentiation assignment  
x **= 3  # Raises x to the power of 3  
print(x)  

## Floor division assignment  
x //= 2  # Performs division and rounds down the result  
print(x)  

### Assigning calculations to variables  

# Addition  
a = 12 + 6  
print(a)  

# Subtraction  
b = 20 - 8  
print(b)  

# Multiplication  
c = 7 * 4  
print(c)  

# Division  
d = 36 / 6  # Always results in a float  
print(d)  

# Modulus  
e = 25 % 4  # Gives the remainder of 25 divided by 4  
print(e)  

# Exponents  
f = 5 ** 3  # 5 raised to the power of 3  
print(f)  

# Floor division  
g = 17 // 3  # 17 divided by 3 and rounded down  
print(g)
